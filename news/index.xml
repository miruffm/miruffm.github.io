&lt;br&gt;
The second Clinical Tuberculosis Symposium of the DGI section &#34;Mycobacterioses&#34; has taken place in Frankfurt. This joint event was organised by DGI, DZIF, DGP, DGPI, and DZK. More than 70 persons participated and learned about the newest evolutions in tuberculosis care and research. We are very happy to have had the opportunity to host this event at University Hospital Frankfurt, Department of Infectious Diseases.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Third round will take place in Heidelberg. See you there!
