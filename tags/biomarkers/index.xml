&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Researchers from Fraunhofer ITMP and the Tropical Institute at LMU Klinikum launched the &amp;ldquo;DisTB&amp;rdquo; study(Discovery of novel biomarkers for the diagnosis of TB disease) at the Fraunhofer ITMP site for Immunology, Infection and Pandemic Research IIP in Penzberg/Munich.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Blood-based test methods such as the interferon-gamma release assay, IGRA for short, have already existed for several years, but it is not possible to differentiate between active tuberculosis disease and a latent tuberculosis infection or previous contact with the bacterium.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The aim of the study is to identify new, highly sensitive and specific biomarkers for the diagnosis of tuberculosis disease that are not based on sputum, but on blood, urine or saliva samples. In addition, a platform for the collection of samples for the discovery and verification of further diagnostic markers is to be created.&lt;br&gt;
