Dedicated POCUS protocols for the diagnosis of HIV-associated extra-pulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) in high incidence settings have been proposed, but reliable accuracy data for both patients with and without HIV are thus far limited. Another arising ultrasound field with great potential is lung ultrasound (LUS) for the diagnosis and the assessment of disease extent for pulmonary TB. Our study ultrasound protocol will cover both abdominal and thoracic locations in both HIV(+) and HIV(-) patients. In addition, we will follow up patients with confirmed TB under anti-mycobacterial therapy to document the natural evolution of TB-associated sonographic findings and assess their value for monitoring of therapy success. With this study we want to fill this gap and to guide implementation efforts by better characterizing the sensitivity and specificity of sonographic findings for TB diagnosis against a comprehensive reference standard. POCUS has the potential to increase TB case finding and avoid over-diagnosis. A study on the accuracy of point-of-care ultrasound for the diagnosis of thoracic and abdominal TB. We investigate the accuracy of both single tuberculosis associated findings as well as composite findings such as combinations of pathological changes. We are enrolling patients with presumed TB regardless of HIV-status and will perform subgroup analysis for patients with/without TB and patients with/without diabetes mellitus as possible risk factors.

To date, genotypic prediction of drug susceptibility in NTM (gDST) is mainly limited to macrolides and aminoglycosides and only well established for M. abscessus, while extensive catalogues of mutational resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex have been established and are used in clinical practice. The increased use of whole genome sequencing as well as the application of standardized methods for pDST might allow to overcome these shortcomings and facilitate the generation of an extensive database with linked gDST and pDST data for NTM. We have the opportunity of generating a unique, large, international dataset of genotypic and phenotypic DST data. The study will include data from NTM isolates assessed in the respective laboratories. No clinical data and therefore no ethical consent will be needed. The submitted data can also be already published. Inclusion criteria:\n bacterial isolate belonging to any NTM-species (clinical, zoonotic or environmental sample) Whole genome sequencing data for isolate available (short read or long read). The data can either be uploaded to a public repository (regardless of sequencing platform) or directly shared (see below) pDST data for isolate available: either SLOMYCO1, SLOMYCO2, RAPMYCO1, RAPMYCO2, potentially other methods How can the data be shared?: The data (i.e. minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICS) and accession numbers of publicly available genome data) can be uploaded via a subsection of the NTMnet registry using a graphical user interface. Please contact the PIs to get an account and instructions. You can also send data (i.e. MICs, accession numbers or whole genome sequencing data in case these are not yet publicly available) via secure servers to one of the PIs. These secure servers can either be set up by your institution or the institution of one of the PIs of this study.

Currently, monitoring these infections relies primarily on microbiological and radiological assessments, both of which have significant limitations. Microbiological tests can be affected by variable sample quality, intermittent mycobacterial shedding, and contamination, while radiological assessments may be challenging to interpret due to underlying chronic lung conditions and raise concerns about cumulative radiation exposure. As a result, there is a need for a systematic, user-friendly method to track disease progression that reduces reliance on costly, invasive procedures. Although patient diaries have been used in other chronic lung diseases, they have not been systematically studied in pulmonary NTM infections. This study seeks to address this gap by exploring how patient diaries can aid in treatment monitoring and enhance assessments of health-related quality of life. The diary-based approach is also expected to reduce the frequency of microbiological and radiological follow-ups, offering potential economic benefits and providing continuous, real-time symptom tracking. The study aims to enroll 200 participants with pulmonary NTM infections across multiple centers. It will include two cohorts: patients undergoing antimicrobial therapy and those not receiving treatment due to clinical or personal reasons. Participants will document daily symptoms, medication adherence, and notable clinical events in a patient diary. Data will be collected at baseline and during follow-up visits, and microbiological and radiological assessments will be performed in parallel to examine correlations between diary entries, microbiological findings, and radiological outcomes. We aim to provide valuable insights into the utility of patient diaries for managing pulmonary NTM infections. The findings could improve patient care and reduce the need for frequent, burdensome microbiological and radiological monitoring.

The latter has been involved in a global outbreak of infections in patients that underwent cardiosurgical interventions. Here, contaminated heater-cooler machines could be identified as point infection source. All three species are present in the environment and have been isolated from water sources in patient homes. However, human-to-human transmission has not been established so far. In CF-patients, M. avium complex is the NTM second most frequently isolated in Europe. If there are dominant circulating clones, as has been described in M. abscessus, remains unclear until now.\n\nObjectives: Investigation of the genomic epidemiology of M. avium complex in multiple centers in Europe.

The incidence of NTM-infections is rising globally. Due to intrinsic antibiotic resistances, they are extremely difficult to treat and associated with severe consequences for individual patients. NTMscope-REPLAGE will use an unique European dataset to characterize resistance determinants, the plasmidome and possible phage therapies in different NTM species. Through the correlation of genotypic and phenotypic susceptibility testing, further resistance genes will be identified and allow a prediction of phenotypic susceptibility based on genomic data. A comprehensive characterization of the plasmidome of NTM will identify plasmids as possible carriers of resistance and virulence genes. Finally, the general susceptibility of different NTM-species to lytic mycobacteriophages will be determined. By combining these different methodological approaches, NTMscope-REPLAGE will facilitate individualized therapies, allow stratified risk assessment by improved diagnostics and therefore contribute significantly to the better management of difficult to treat NTM-infections.\nFunding: BMBF Status: Project ongoing\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"acceb864a47882dfda9c6d5960357e3a","permalink":"https://miru-ffm.org/project/ntmscope-replage/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/ntmscope-replage/","section":"project","summary":"REsistance determinants, PLAsmid pathogenicity, and phAGE Therapy in non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM).","tags":["NTM","M. avium complex","M. xenopi","M. kansasii","M. xenopi","SGM","slow growing mycobacteria"],"title":"NTMscope-REPLAGE","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Tools MTBseq NTM-Profiler Projects NTMscope Repositories NTMtools Organizations NTM-NET TBnet Other links Research Center Borstel Department of Infectious Diseases, University Hospital Frankfurt Institute for Medical Microbiology and Hygiene, University Hospital Frankfurt\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"74f7fb04a75e766307d398251c369a21","permalink":"https://miru-ffm.org/resources/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/resources/","section":"","summary":"Tools MTBseq NTM-Profiler Projects NTMscope Repositories NTMtools Organizations NTM-NET TBnet Other links Research Center Borstel Department of Infectious Diseases, University Hospital Frankfurt Institute for Medical Microbiology and Hygiene, University Hospital Frankfurt","tags":null,"title":"Resources","type":"page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This project aims to explore sex and gender differences in tuberculosis by systematically evaluating and summarizing the available evidence.
