Dedicated POCUS protocols for the diagnosis of HIV-associated extra-pulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) in high incidence settings have been proposed, but reliable accuracy data for both patients with and without HIV are thus far limited. Another arising ultrasound field with great potential is lung ultrasound (LUS) for the diagnosis and the assessment of disease extent for pulmonary TB. Our study ultrasound protocol will cover both abdominal and thoracic locations in both HIV(+) and HIV(-) patients. In addition, we will follow up patients with confirmed TB under anti-mycobacterial therapy to document the natural evolution of TB-associated sonographic findings and assess their value for monitoring of therapy success. With this study we want to fill this gap and to guide implementation efforts by better characterizing the sensitivity and specificity of sonographic findings for TB diagnosis against a comprehensive reference standard. POCUS has the potential to increase TB case finding and avoid over-diagnosis. A study on the accuracy of point-of-care ultrasound for the diagnosis of thoracic and abdominal TB. We investigate the accuracy of both single tuberculosis associated findings as well as composite findings such as combinations of pathological changes. We are enrolling patients with presumed TB regardless of HIV-status and will perform subgroup analysis for patients with/without TB and patients with/without diabetes mellitus as possible risk factors. The aim is the description of possible combinations for a point-of-care protocol, which can be used as a non-sputum based triage test for TB. In addition, we evaluate patients longitudinally with ultrasound to determine the value for therapy monitoring for pulmonary and extrapulmonary findings.\n\nMore Information\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"23784820544d0307a698456fae61f1c5","permalink":"https://miru-ffm.org/collaboration/pocustb/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/collaboration/pocustb/","section":"collaboration","summary":"Point-of-care-ultrasound in the diagnosis of TB.","tags":["POCUS","Point-of-care-ultrasound","TB","Tuberculosis","ALL POCUS TB"],"title":"ALL POCUS TB","type":"collaboration"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"For further information information or to contribute to one of our studies, please email to info[at]ntmscope[dot]org or contact: PD Dr. Nils Wetzstein nils.wetzstein[at]ntmscope[at]org  University Hospital Frankfurt Department of Internal Medicine, Infectious Diseases Theodor-Stern-Kai 7 60590 Frankfurt ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"3c4864f00d23f7ea35511ec930ce1d9c","permalink":"https://miru-ffm.org/contact/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/contact/","section":"","summary":"For further information information or to contribute to one of our studies, please email to info[at]ntmscope[dot]org or contact: PD Dr. Nils Wetzstein nils.wetzstein[at]ntmscope[at]org  University Hospital Frankfurt Department of Internal Medicine, Infectious Diseases Theodor-Stern-Kai 7 60590 Frankfurt ","tags":null,"title":"Contact","type":"page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Introduction: Tuberculosis can cause extensive lung damage leading to respiratory insufficiency.

While pulmonary tuberculosis remains the most prevalent form of the disease, approximately 24% of tuberculosis cases diagnosed in Germany involve extrapulmonary organs, according to the 2023 RKI report. Diagnosing and treating EPTB may pose distinct challenges due to its varied clinical presentations, nonspecific symptoms, and paradoxical reactions during the course of treatment. The goal of this three-year DZIF-funded study is to facilitate a biomarker-based treatment approach for EPTB patients. This will be achieved by identifying biomarkers associated with EPTB and determining risk factors that contribute to the development of EPTB. To achieve these objectives, clinical data and patient samples from EPTB patients are being systematically collected, analyzed, and evaluated at six DZIF study sites in Germany: Bonn, Borstel, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Heidelberg, and Cologne. The study, conducted under the leadership of DZIF researchers Priv.-Doz. Dr. Isabelle Suárez and Prof. Dr. Jan Rybniker at the University Hospital Cologne (UHC), aims to contribute to the improved diagnosis and treatment of EPTB not only in Germany but worldwide. It is a continuation of the monocentric DZIF-funded pilot study (EX-TB study) that has been running at UHC since 2018.
